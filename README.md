# 📊 Statistics Calculator

A simple statistics calculator built in JavaScript while following the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/learn-advanced-array-methods-by-building-a-statistics-calculator/) *Advanced Array Methods* course.  

It demonstrates how to use JavaScript array methods like `.reduce()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.sort()` to compute statistical values.
